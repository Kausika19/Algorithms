# Algorithms

## Description
This a Java program to find the fastest journey time route between any 2 stations in a specified section of the TfL tube network. This is done by representing the tube network as a graph and using E.W. Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorithm to find the fastest route between the two tube stations.
